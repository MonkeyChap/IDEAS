        The IDEAS Group was established in 2005 to align the national architecture frameworks of the defense departments of Australia, Canada, UK and USA. The result was a formal ontology which went on to be used in DoDAF, MODAF and UPDM (now UAF). 
        <br/><br/>
        As well as working on meta-models, the group allowed the various members to gain a better understanding of each others' approaches. As a result, the documentation of MODAF 1.1 was revised to reflect the
        logical nature of the OV viewpoint. It also meant that DoDAF decided to adopt some of the views from MODAF - the capability and acquisition views.  
        <br/><br/>
        The ontology development work was led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailey/">Ian Bailey</a> from <a href="http://www.modelfutures.com">Model Futures</a> with major contributions from BORO Solutions, Syntell AB,
        Cornwell Management Consulting (later Serco), Silver Bullet inc., Mitre, and the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA). 
        <br/><br/>
        The IDEAS Foundation model can be viewed <a href="foundation/index.htm">here</a> 
        <br/><br/>
        The US Department of Defense DoDAF DM2 model can be viewed <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Library/DoD-Architecture-Framework/dodaf20_dm2/">here</a> 
        <br/><br/>
        The MODEM (MODAF Ontology) model can be viewed <a href="modem/index.htm">here</a> 
        <br/><br/>
        The UAF Domain Meta-Model (based on MODEM and DM2) can be viewed <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/UAF/1.1/DMM/PDF">here</a>
        All models are in UML. 
        <br/><br/>
        Since IDEAS was released, the UK Government has also published a data exchange standard (the IES) which re-uses many of the concepts established in BORO and IDEAS. UK Govt IES website is still under construction, but there is a temporary site that can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/Telicent-io/ies-test-repo/blob/master/ies.md">here</a>
        <br/><br/>
        The <a href="https://github.com/MonkeyChap/ideasgroup.org">IDEAS Group GitHub repository</a> contains all the original models (as Sparx EA files) and the software we developed at the time to process and check the models.
