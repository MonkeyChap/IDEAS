        The IDEAS Group was established in 2005 to align national architecture frameworks. This was initially Australia, Canada, UK and USA, with Sweden, France and NATO joining later on. The goal
        of the group was to align the frameworks by comparing their respective meta-models and viewpoints. The result was a formal ontology which went on to be used in DoDAF, MODAF and UPDM (now UAF). 
        <br/><br/>
        As well as working on meta-models, the group allowed the various members to gain a better understanding of each others' approaches. As a result, the documentation of MODAF 1.1 was revised to reflect the
        logical nature of the OV viewpoint. It also meant that DoDAF decided to adopt some of the views from MODAF - the capability and acquisition views.  
        <br/><br/>
        The ontology development work was led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailey/">Ian Bailey</a> from <a href="http://www.modelfutures.com">Model Futures</a> with major contributions from Syntell AB,
        Cornwell Management Consulting (later Serco), Silver Bullet inc., Mitre, and the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA).
